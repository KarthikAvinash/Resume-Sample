    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a third-year Computer Science and Engineering student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology,
        Dharwad, with a strong academic background, holding a CPI of 9.44. Leveraging my passion for technology, I have
        completed impactful projects, including a heart disease prediction system and an innovative timetable automation
        solution. My internship experiences, such as at iHUB DivyaSampark, IIT Roorkee, have equipped me with practical
        skills in machine learning and AI. Actively engaged in extracurricular activities, I have served as a Technical
        Content Creator for IRIS CLUB and am an active member of IEEE CS Branch. Noteworthy achievements include
        generating optimized timetables for all semesters at IIIT Dharwad and securing Elite-Gold status in NPTEL's
        "Problem Solving Through Programming in C" exam. Eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to challenging
        projects in the field of computer science.</p>
